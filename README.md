## Brief

> Build a mobile-responsive website using Bootstrap.

After hearing from many people about how quick it was to spin up a website using Bootstrap, I decided to give it a go. I watched a few tutorials and read the documentation, which was very well written and easy to follow.

I knew I wanted to create somehting that was functioning and could be good to show off my skills in using Bootstrap. Eventually, I went with the idea of a landing page for an app idea I had - Tinder for properties.
